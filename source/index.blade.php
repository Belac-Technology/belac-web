    <h1>Purpose</h1>
    <p>Belac is dedicated to small and medium businesses wanting to innovate, grow and lead in an environment that requires connecting
        closely with partners, suppliers and customers through shared business processes and transactions.</p>

    <p>Belac is developing technology, processes, patterns and disciplines to this end.  These assets are focused on
    small and medium sized businesses not large enterprises and hyper scale companies that have different problems.
    The temptation with technical teams is to want to emulate these solutions and practices used by these pioneers with
    insufficient resources and incorrect scenarios for their environment leading to unhappy, disillusioned business leaders.
    There are businesses that have technical teams that are less adventurous relying on what has been put in place in a
        different business environment.</p>

    <p>The goal is to build a team focused on the business domain layer of technology that is fully integrated
    into the business and passionate about jointly solving and innovating in the business systems space that produces
        reliable high value solutions that encourages low risk evolution.</p>
